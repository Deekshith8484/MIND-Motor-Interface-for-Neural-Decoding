# MIND-Motor-Interface-for-Neural-Decoding
MIND (Motor Interface for Neural Decoding) is a proof-of-concept system that decodes muscle activity (EMG signals) into hand/wrist gestures for controlling virtual or physical devices like robotic arms or prosthetics.

Built with a focus on minimal invasiveness, real-time processing, and deep learning, MIND bridges the gap between raw biosignals and intuitive motion control.

🚀 Features
📦 End-to-End Pipeline for EMG-based gesture recognition:

Signal preprocessing (bandpass filtering, windowing)

Feature extraction (RMS, MAV, WL, ZC, SSC)

Deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, TCN)

Real-time gesture classification

🎮 Unity3D Interface for visualizing gesture control with a virtual robotic arm

🧠 Surface EMG Input (from armbands or sensors) — no surgery, no implants

⚙️ Modular and extensible for additional sensors or new gesture sets

💡 Use Cases
Prosthetic control for amputees

Muscle-based HCI / gesture recognition

Real-time robotic arm operation

Biofeedback and rehabilitation training
